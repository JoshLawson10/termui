# Core Concepts

TermUI is built around four primitives:

1. **App** – runs your program, manages rendering and input.
2. **Screen** – logical views inside an App.
3. **Layout** – controls how widgets are arranged (Vertical, Horizontal, Grid).
4. **Widget** – interactive UI components (Button, Input, etc.).
5. **Theme** – centralized colors and style tokens.

Together, these let you build composable, consistent UIs.
